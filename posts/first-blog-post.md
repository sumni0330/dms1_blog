# This is 1A
Learning the For Loop

I came from RMIT Vietnam, and I had a professor there who I became quite close with. I recently revisited their personal site and reviewed the concept of the for loop, something they had taught me before.
Using that professor’s website as a reference helped me refresh my understanding.
📌 Basic for loop structure




```js
for (initialization; condition; update) {
  // code to repeat
}
* Initialization: Declare a variable and set a starting value
* Condition: The loop continues as long as this condition is true
* Update: Updates the variable each time the loop runs
Example:
javascript
CopyEdit
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i); // prints 0 to 4
}
A nested for loop to create a grid:
javascript
CopyEdit
for (let y = 0; y < height; y += gridSize) {
  for (let x = 0; x < width; x += gridSize) {
    rect(x, y, gridSize, gridSize);
  }
}
```


📌 Creating a Grid Using Nested Loops Efficiently
When I first started learning p5.js, I practiced using a basic for loop to draw a single row of rectangles. But I wanted to try something more interesting, so I used multiple for loops to create a full grid efficiently. Here’s a look at the process I followed and what I learned.
📍 My first attempt
At first, I wasn’t quite sure how to draw a grid, so I asked ChatGPT for help. It gave me this simple example:




## Canvas API + p5.js

<script src="./scripts/p5.js"></script>
<canvas id="p5_example"></canvas>

<script>
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  let size = 40;

  for (let x = 0; x < width; x += size) {
    for (let y = 0; y < height; y += size) {
      rect(x, y, size, size);
    }
  }
}
</script>

Explanation from ChatGPT:
* The outer loop goes horizontally across the canvas in steps of size.
* The inner loop moves vertically in the same way, drawing a square at each (x, y) position.
* rect(x, y, size, size) draws a rectangle at the specified location.

📌 Adding Color
I wanted to get more creative, so I asked ChatGPT how I could apply color to each square. It suggested using the HSB color mode to create a gradient effect based on position:


## Canvas API + p5.js

<script src="./scripts/p5.js"></script>
<canvas id="p5_example"></canvas>

<script>
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  colorMode(HSB, width, height, 100);
  noStroke();
  let size = 40;

  for (let x = 0; x < width; x += size) {
    for (let y = 0; y < height; y += size) {
      fill(x, y, 100);
      rect(x, y, size, size);
    }
  }
}
</script>

Using colorMode(HSB, width, height, 100) sets the color range based on canvas dimensions. By using (x, y) as inputs to fill(), each square takes on a slightly different hue, resulting in a gradient. It was so cool to see how position could influence color!

📌 Adding Mouse Interaction
Just using color wasn’t enough—I wanted to make it interactive. I asked ChatGPT how to change colors based on mouse movement:

## Canvas API + p5.js

<script src="./scripts/p5.js"></script>
<canvas id="p5_example"></canvas>

<script>
function draw() {
  background(240);
  let size = 40;

  for (let x = 0; x < width; x += size) {
    for (let y = 0; y < height; y += size) {
      if (mouseX > x && mouseX < x + size && mouseY > y && mouseY < y + size) {
        fill(255, 0, 0); // red if hovered
      } else {
        fill(180); // grey otherwise
      }
      rect(x, y, size, size);
    }
  }
}
</script>

ChatGPT explained that by checking if mouseX and mouseY fall within a square’s boundaries, we can change the color of just that square. This helped me understand how to make interactive visual effects.

📌 Adding Animation
Finally, I wanted to explore animated color changes over time. ChatGPT suggested using frameCount:

## Canvas API + p5.js

<script src="./scripts/p5.js"></script>
<canvas id="p5_example"></canvas>

<script>
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100);
  noStroke();
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  let size = 40;

  for (let x = 0; x < width; x += size) {
    for (let y = 0; y < height; y += size) {
      fill((frameCount + x + y) % 360, 80, 100);
      rect(x, y, size, size);
    }
  }
}
</script>

ChatGPT explained that frameCount increases with every frame, creating dynamic, ever-changing colors when combined with (x + y). The % 360 keeps the hue within a valid range. It was fascinating to see how animation could be driven by time and position.

✨ Inspired by Rafaël Rozendaal’s Le Duchamp ✨
One digital art piece that really caught my attention was Le Duchamp by Rafaël Rozendaal. I love minimalism, and this piece immediately spoke to me with its black-and-white design and simple line art.
But what amazed me most was the interaction. When I moved the mouse, the wheels spun, and even their shadows shifted—it was so magical! I had so many questions: How was this even made?
So I started Googling, watching YouTube videos, and of course, asking ChatGPT. Here’s a little of what I learned.

📌 Technical Diagram (from ChatGPT)

 │   └─ Apply Post-Effects
 └── Event Handling
     ├─ Mouse/Touch Events
     └─ Window/Resize Events
At first, this diagram was confusing. But ChatGPT explained it in simple terms:
* Rendering Loop: Repeatedly draws the screen using requestAnimationFrame, allowing animation.
* Event Handling: Detects user input (like mouse movement or resizing the window) and reacts to it.

📌 Example Code Structure (from ChatGPT)
## Canvas API + p5.js

<script src="./scripts/p5.js"></script>
<canvas id="p5_example"></canvas>

<script>
class LeDuchampApp {
  constructor() {
    this.canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
    this.ctx = this.canvas.getContext('2d');
    document.body.appendChild(this.canvas);

    this.resizeCanvas();
    this.setupEventListeners();
    this.initializeElements();

    this.lastTime = 0;
    this.animate(0);
  }

  resizeCanvas() {
    this.canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
    this.canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
  }

  setupEventListeners() {
    window.addEventListener('resize', this.resizeCanvas.bind(this));
    this.canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', this.handleMouseMove.bind(this));
  }

  initializeElements() {
    this.particles = [];
  }

  animate(currentTime) {
    const deltaTime = currentTime - this.lastTime;
    this.lastTime = currentTime;

    this.update(deltaTime);
    this.render();

    requestAnimationFrame(this.animate.bind(this));
  }

  update(deltaTime) {
    // Update logic
  }

  render() {
    this.ctx.clearRect(0, 0, this.canvas.width, this.canvas.height);
    // Drawing logic
  }

  handleMouseMove(event) {
    // Mouse interaction logic
  }
}
</script>

new LeDuchampApp();
Honestly, this looked super overwhelming at first. But after more questions, I understood that it’s doing three main things:
1. Creates a canvas and displays it on the webpage
2. Handles events like mouse movement and window resizing
3. Continuously updates and redraws the canvas for animation

📚 Concepts I Need to Learn
To understand and eventually create works like Le Duchamp, I realized I need to learn the following:
1. Canvas API Basics
    * Drawing with HTML canvas
    * Using requestAnimationFrame for animation
2. Principles of Generative Art
    * Creating visual forms with code
    * Using randomness and rules to generate images
3. Noise Functions
    * Creating smooth, organic movement
    * Learning about Perlin noise (random yet natural-looking motion)
4. Particle Systems
    * Simulating small moving elements
    * Learning basic motion physics
5. Animation Techniques
    * Easing, waves, and fluid motion
6. Interaction Design
    * Handling user input like mouse or touch
    * Making visuals responsive to different screen sizes

📚 Helpful Resources
* p5.js Official Docs
* Renick Bell’s site (my professor from RMIT Vietnam)
* The Coding Train YouTube – super beginner-friendly!
* The Nature of Code – for natural movement
* YouTube tutorials on Perlin Noise

✨ Final Thoughts
Through this learning journey and while preparing for this assignment, I feel like I gained a much deeper understanding of for loops and how to use them in creative ways.
When I first saw Le Duchamp, I was honestly just filled with wonder—How was that even made? I still don’t understand every technical detail, but through research and curiosity, I’ve discovered that generative art is such an inspiring field.
I'm still a beginner, but I hope that one day I can create something like that too. Thanks so much for reading! 😊


## This is 1B

## 💬 Conversation with Classmates about Rafaël Rozendaal’s *Le Duchamp*

This time, I had a chat with my classmates Changjo and Wonjun about the artwork *[Le Duchamp](https://www.leduchamp.com)* by Rafaël Rozendaal. Like me, they don’t really know how to code, but we freely shared our impressions just by looking at the piece.

### 🗣️ What Changjo said:
**How does this work move internally?**  
> “It’s so cool how the wheel follows the mouse and even the shadow moves with it. It kind of feels like you’re spinning a real wheel with your hand. Maybe it’s just programmed to follow the mouse.”

**What would I need to learn to recreate this?**  
> “Probably how to draw things like the wheel and its shadow first. Then, maybe figure out how to make them follow the mouse.”

**How should I learn it?**  
> “I searched for stuff like ‘p5.js follow mouse’ on YouTube. At first it was confusing, but copying the videos helped a lot. I really like the channel *The Coding Train* — it’s super beginner-friendly! These days I also watch a Korean channel called *Brain Building*. It explains p5.js in Korean and it’s super kind and detailed. You should totally check it out!”

---

### 🗣️ What Wonjun said:
**How does this work move?**  
> “The wheel spins really slowly, and the shadow follows along—it’s kinda mesmerizing. It doesn’t seem random. It looks like it's moving in a regular pattern, which is really fascinating.”

**What would I need to learn to recreate this?**  
> “I think learning how to make things move smoothly is key. And also how to make the shadow follow along.”

**How should I learn it?**  
> “I once watched a p5.js video where a rainbow moved slowly. That’s how I learned about something called `frameCount`. It changes over time and makes animations happen. If you try following along like that, you’ll start to get the hang of it. I also like the *1MinuteCoding* channel. The videos are short and explain basic stuff really well—including p5.js!”

---

### 📘 What I need to learn:
- Practice drawing shapes like the wheel and its shadow  
- Learn how to make graphics respond to mouse movement  
- Make movements smooth and gradual using time or numbers (e.g., `frameCount`)

---

### 📚 Useful Resources:
- *The Coding Train* (YouTube, English but very visual and clear)  
- *Brain Building* (YouTube, Korean, friendly explanations of p5.js)  
- *1MinuteCoding* (YouTube, short and clear Korean videos for beginners)  
- The [p5.js official site](https://p5js.org) (lots of code examples)  
- Search terms on YouTube: “p5.js follow mouse,” “p5.js animation,” “p5.js move drawing”

🧪 *Following the Wheel Style of "Le Duchamp"*

After seeing the smooth, rotating black-and-white wheels on the [Le Duchamp](https://www.leduchamp.com) website and wondering, "Can I make something like this?" I decided to give it a try. Since I was just starting to learn coding and knew nothing, I asked ChatGPT for help step by step, very slowly. Below is a record of what I didn’t know, how ChatGPT helped me, and what I learned through it.



At first, I showed ChatGPT the wheel image and simply said, “I want to make this.” Naturally, I thought it would just provide the code immediately, but ChatGPT took me through the basics one by one.

ChatGPT explained that to draw a picture, you first need a canvas, like a piece of paper, and in p5.js, you can create this canvas with `createCanvas()`. For example, `createCanvas(600, 600)` would create a 600x600 canvas.

I actually knew this part, but I didn’t fully understand why `createCanvas()` needs to be inside the `setup()` function. Then ChatGPT explained that the `setup()` function is run only once when the program starts, so the canvas should be created there, and the `draw()` function is where you continuously draw on the canvas.

So, I wrote the code like this:


```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 600);
}
```


And since drawing shapes should be done inside the `draw()` function, I wrote:

```js
function draw() {
  background(255);
  ellipse(300, 300, 300, 300);
}
```

With this basic structure, when I ran the code, a perfect circle appeared right in the center of the screen! That’s when I realized, “Ah, I can start drawing the wheel here.”

I didn’t know the formula for `ellipse`, so I asked ChatGPT, and it explained:

`ellipse(x, y, w, h);`
- `x`: x-coordinate of the center of the circle
- `y`: y-coordinate of the center of the circle
- `w`: width (horizontal length)
- `h`: height (vertical length)

So, `ellipse(300, 300, 300, 300);` can be interpreted as:

“Draw a circle with a width of 300 and a height of 300 at the position x=300, y=300 on the screen.”  
Since the width and height are the same, it creates a circle. If they were different, it would create an ellipse.

I realized that it's not enough to just know `createCanvas()`, but understanding the roles of `setup()` and `draw()` is essential for structuring the code properly. I also learned that using `background()` inside `draw()` is necessary to clear the previous frame and draw a new one. As I adjusted the shape's position, I saw that changing the center coordinates moved the shape, and changing the size values made the shape bigger or smaller, which helped me slowly understand how things worked.

(Additionally, ChatGPT showed me how to apply this: `ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 100, 100)` → This makes the circle follow the mouse. This also goes inside `draw()`.)



At first, I drew a single circle, but manually inputting numbers like `ellipse(300, 300, ...)` was really inconvenient. Especially, I wanted to perfectly align the wheel with the center of the screen, but it was cumbersome to constantly remember and calculate the width and height. So, I asked ChatGPT if there was an easier way.

ChatGPT explained that instead of manually inputting numbers like (300, 300), you can shift the coordinate system to be based on the center of the screen using `translate(width / 2, height / 2)`. This makes (0, 0) the center of the canvas, so whenever you want to draw something centered, you can just input (0, 0), which is much easier.

After hearing this, I added `translate()` inside the `draw()` function:

```js
function draw() {
  background(255);
  translate(width / 2, height / 2);
  ellipse(0, 0, 300, 300);
}
```

After making this change, the circle was now perfectly positioned at the center of the screen just by drawing it at (0, 0). Also, since I could now calculate left/right as negative/positive values and up/down the same way, it became much more intuitive and easier.

### What does `translate(width / 2, height / 2);` mean?
In p5.js, the default coordinate system has (0, 0) at the top-left of the screen, and the numbers increase as you move towards the bottom-right.  
For example:
- `width` is the horizontal length of the canvas
- `height` is the vertical length of the canvas

So, `translate(width / 2, height / 2);` moves the origin of the coordinate system to the center of the screen.  
In simple terms, it means, “From now on, I’m changing the reference point for drawing shapes to the center of the screen.” Initially, I was manually calculating the coordinates, but after using `translate()`, the coordinates became much simpler. I realized how convenient it is to have (0, 0) as the center.

### Why change the coordinate system?
The reason this is important is that it makes tasks like rotation, symmetry, and center alignment much easier.  
Let’s compare the two approaches:

1. **Without changing the coordinate system:**
```js
ellipse(width / 2, height / 2, 300, 300);
```
→ You have to manually calculate and input the center.

2. **After shifting the coordinate system:**
```js
translate(width / 2, height / 2);
ellipse(0, 0, 300, 300);
```
→ Since the origin is now at the center, you just input (0, 0).

👉 The second method is much simpler and more intuitive.  
Later, when using `rotate()` to rotate shapes, the center of rotation will naturally be the middle of the screen, because the origin is already there.

In the general coordinate system, it feels like you’re drawing with a sticky note in the top-left corner of your desk, but using `translate()` is like moving the sticky note to the center of your desk and drawing from there.

✨ **What I learned from using it:**
At first, I thought, “Why is this so complicated?” But after making things like a rotating wheel, I realized that shifting the coordinate system is essential for rotating or aligning shapes around their center.

---

Now, moving on to rotating the wheel!

I didn’t want just a stationary circle, I wanted to implement "rotation" like in *Le Duchamp*.

ChatGPT told me that there's a function called `rotate()`. `rotate()` is the function in p5.js that rotates shapes.  
But to rotate something, you need to tell it *how much* to rotate, right?  
This value is called the `rotation` variable.



```js
let rotation = 0;

function draw() {
  background(255);
  translate(width / 2, height / 2);
  
  ellipse(0, 0, 300, 300);
  rotation += 0.01;
}

rotate(PI / 4); // Rotate 45 degrees
```

But if we just rotate with a fixed number like this, the shape will only rotate once and stop.  
So, we need to create a variable called `rotation` and update its value slightly in each frame so the rotation continues.

So, what does `rotation += 0.01;` mean?

This is code that gradually increases the rotation angle.

- `rotation` is a variable that holds the angle (in radians).
- `+= 0.01` means "increase the rotation value by 0.01 each frame."

As a result:
`rotate(rotation);` will take the increasingly larger value and make the shape rotate continuously.

Here’s the example code again:

```js
let rotation = 0;

function draw() {
  background(255);
  translate(width / 2, height / 2);
  rotate(rotation);
  ellipse(0, 0, 300, 300);
  rotation += 0.01;
}
```

**What I learned at this stage:**  
I understood the concept that `rotate()` rotates the shape, and that using operations like `+=` allows the value to accumulate over time, creating an animation.


**Drawing the Spokes**

There were several spokes in the wheel, so how do you draw them?

At first, I thought, “Maybe I can just use `line()` multiple times,” but that seemed inefficient, and I’d have to manually calculate the exact position for each one. So, I asked ChatGPT for help.

ChatGPT suggested that since the spokes are evenly spaced like in a bicycle wheel, it would be better to divide the angles evenly and draw the lines. 

First, decide how many spokes you want (`numSpokes`), then divide 360 degrees (or 2π radians) by that number. Use `cos()` and `sin()` to calculate the coordinates of the outer points for each angle, and then draw a line from the center to each point.

When I heard that, I thought, “Ah, this is just like finding the points on a circle that are a certain distance (the radius) from the center!”

Here’s the first code I wrote:

```js
const numSpokes = 28;
for (let i = 0; i < numSpokes; i++) {
  let angle = (i / numSpokes) * TWO_PI;
  let x = cos(angle) * 150;
  let y = sin(angle) * 150;
  line(0, 0, x, y);
}
```

This part was really hard for me. It felt like math. But ChatGPT explained that "`cos` is for horizontal direction, `sin` is for vertical direction," and when I thought of it like a clock, I finally understood.

- `const numSpokes = 28;`  
This declares that I want 28 spokes. It means I’m dividing one circle into 28 equal parts.

- `for (let i = 0; i < numSpokes; i++) { ... }`  
This means that `i` will go from 0 to 27, so the loop runs 28 times, drawing 28 spokes.

- `let angle = (i / numSpokes) * TWO_PI;`  
`TWO_PI` means 360 degrees or 2π radians.  
This line divides the circle into `numSpokes` parts and calculates the angle for the `i`-th spoke. For example:  
  - When `i = 0`, the angle is 0.  
  - When `i = 14`, the angle is half a circle (π).  
  - When `i = 27`, the angle is almost 360 degrees (close to 2π).

- `let x = cos(angle) * 150;`  
- `let y = sin(angle) * 150;`  
These lines use trigonometry to calculate the position of the point at the specified angle.  
Since the radius is 150, it calculates the coordinates of the point 150 units away from the center of the wheel, at the specified angle.  
  - `cos(angle)` gives the horizontal position  
  - `sin(angle)` gives the vertical position  
In other words, this is the formula for finding the point that is a distance of 150 from the center in the direction of the given angle.

- `line(0, 0, x, y);`  
This draws a line from the center (0, 0) to the point `(x, y)` that we just calculated.

Visually, this means:
- The lines spread out in directions like 0°, 12°, 24°... all the way to 360°.
- Using `cos()` and `sin()` to find the end points, and then drawing lines from the center to those points.
- The spokes fan out from the center, just like on a wheel.

**What I learned at this stage:**  
I learned how to divide a circle into 360 degrees, how to convert angles into numbers, and how to use `cos` and `sin` to calculate directions. This felt like connecting math with coding.


**Wheel Center**

The center of the wheel felt too empty, so I wanted to add a point of focus.

```js
fill(0);
ellipse(0, 0, 15, 15);
fill(255);
ellipse(0, 0, 5, 5);
```

### Step 6: How to draw the fixed bar?

How do you draw the black bar under the wheel? In *Le Duchamp*, the wheel looks like it's fixed to some structure.

When I first asked this, I didn't even know how to differentiate between rotating and fixed elements. At first, I drew the bar along with the wheel, but when the wheel rotated and the bar moved with it, I realized "Something's wrong."

ChatGPT explained that the wheel is the rotating element, and the bar is the fixed element. In p5.js, everything drawn after the `rotate()` function will be rotated, so a fixed element like the bar should be drawn before the `rotate()` function. More precisely, after using `translate()` to move the coordinate system to the center, draw the bar with `line()` before the `rotate()` function. This way, the bar stays fixed and doesn't rotate.

That’s when I realized, "Ah, the order of functions in the code actually changes the behavior of the drawing."

```js
stroke(0);
strokeWeight(10);
line(0, 0, 0, radius * 1.2);
```

After doing this, finally! The wheel rotated, and the bar stayed fixed, making it look just like a real bicycle wheel.

Whether a shape rotates or stays fixed is determined by whether it’s drawn before or after the `rotate()` function. I understood that the order of the code doesn’t just edit the drawing but directly affects the movement.

---

### ✨ Final Result

Here’s the complete code for the wheel I created by learning step by step:

**Canvas API + p5.js**

```html
<script src="./scripts/p5.js"></script>
<canvas id="p5_example"></canvas>

<script>
let rotation = 0;
let wheelSize = 300;
let radius = wheelSize / 2;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 600);
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  translate(width / 2, height / 2);

  // Fixed bar of the wheel
  stroke(0);
  strokeWeight(10);
  line(0, 0, 0, radius * 1.2);

  push();
  rotate(rotation);

  // Wheel outline
  stroke(0);
  strokeWeight(5);
  noFill();
  ellipse(0, 0, wheelSize, wheelSize);

  // Spokes of the wheel
  const numSpokes = 28;
  strokeWeight(1);
  for (let i = 0; i < numSpokes; i++) {
    let angle = (i / numSpokes) * TWO_PI;
    let x = cos(angle) * radius;
    let y = sin(angle) * radius;
    line(0, 0, x, y);
    strokeWeight(3);
    point(x, y);
    strokeWeight(1);
  }

  // Center hub
  fill(0);
  ellipse(0, 0, 15, 15);
  fill(255);
  ellipse(0, 0, 5, 5);

  pop();

  // Rotation speed
  rotation += 0.01;
}
</script>
```

---

### 🎯 Final Thoughts

What I realized through this process is that **even if you don't know coding at all, if you keep asking questions, trying things, and executing them, eventually you'll understand**.

It was just about making a wheel spin, but I learned about coordinate systems, loops, math functions, animation principles, and the importance of code order. While it's not perfect yet, I feel a great sense of pride whenever I see the code working.



# This is 2A

## 🧸 Experimenting with Cute Creations – Designing Cuteness with p5.js

For this project, I spent some time thinking and planning how to implement **cute visuals, cute sounds, and cute interactions** using p5.js. Initially, I got inspired by Le Duchamp’s rotating wheel artwork and wanted to create a scene where a puppy runs along with the wheel. I considered how to make it “cute” and organized my thoughts step by step.

---

### 🎨 1. Creating Cute Visuals

Cute visuals typically have the following features:

- **Round shapes** (round faces, short limbs)
- **Pastel colors** (soft, gentle colors)
- **Small, repetitive movements** (like hopping or gently swaying)

#### 📌 Examples:
- A small puppy running inside the wheel
- A bunny character with large eyes following the mouse
- A jelly creature shaking on a cloud

In p5.js, these can be created using functions like `ellipse()`, `colorMode()`, and `sin()`.

---

### 🎧 2. Creating Cute Sounds

Cute sounds are light and cheerful sounds that make you smile when you hear them. For example:

- A "boing" sound
- A small "squeak" sound like an animal
- A bouncing sound of an object hitting the floor

With p5.js, you can use the `p5.sound` library to create sounds like "boing" with an `Oscillator` or short, cute sounds using an `envelope`.

For my project, I found a cute sound from Mixkit, a free sound website. I’ll use this sound:

🔊 **Happy puppy barks** from [mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/dog](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/dog/)

This sound will play every time the puppy runs along with the wheel.

#### 📌 Examples:
- Play a short "woof!" sound whenever the puppy runs
- Add a click sound at intervals as the wheel rotates
- Play the Happy puppy barks sound when clicked

---

### 🐾 3. Creating Cute Interactions

Cute interactions refer to responsive, lifelike behaviors, even with simple actions. For example:

- **When the mouse is dragged, the puppy starts running**
- **When it stops, the puppy pauses and looks like it's out of breath**
- **Clicking makes the puppy wag its tail or smile**

To make these reactions, I’ll need to use functions like `mousePressed()`, `mouseDragged()`, and `rotation` variables, along with conditional statements to change movements or expressions.

---

### 📅 AT1 Project Concept – Puppy Running in the Wheel

### 🧠 Basic Idea

I took the idea from Le Duchamp's rotating wheel and wanted to create a structure where **a puppy runs along with the wheel**.

- The wheel keeps rotating,
- The puppy starts running when the mouse is dragged or when the wheel rotates.
- When the rotation stops, the puppy also stops and appears to pant.
- The "Happy puppy barks" sound will play when the puppy runs.

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

- Wheel rotation: `rotate()`, `rotation += 0.01`, adjusting for drag speed
- Puppy animation: Use `frameCount` and conditional statements to animate the puppy’s movement frame by frame
- Mouse interaction: Using `mousePressed()`, `mouseDragged()`, and `mouseReleased()`
- Sound: Play the external sound file with `p5.sound`, and trigger the Happy puppy barks sound on click

---

### Sketch Example I Made

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  translate(width / 2, height / 2);

  // Wheel outline
  stroke(0);
  strokeWeight(5);
  noFill();
  ellipse(0, 0, 300);

  // Spokes
  strokeWeight(1);
  const numSpokes = 12;
  for (let i = 0; i < numSpokes; i++) {
    let angle = (i / numSpokes) * TWO_PI;
    let x = cos(angle) * 150;
    let y = sin(angle) * 150;
    line(0, 0, x, y);
  }

  // Simple puppy drawing
  noStroke();
  fill(255, 200, 200);
  ellipse(0, 70, 40, 25); // Body
  fill(0);
  ellipse(-10, 65, 5); // Eye
  ellipse(10, 65, 5); // Eye
  stroke(0);
  line(-5, 75, 5, 75); // Mouth
}
```

---

### 🎯 Future Plans

- Add frames for the puppy animation to make it run with the wheel's rotation
- Make the puppy wag its tail when it runs, and pant when it stops
- Play a short laughing sound or **Happy puppy barks** when clicked
- Add the ability to actually drag and rotate the wheel

# This is 2B


### **Describing the Kindred Spirit for Your AT1:**

**1. Who is your kindred spirit?**
In this context, my kindred spirit is an energetic and playful puppy. The puppy is a symbol of innocence, joy, and curiosity—traits that mirror my creative approach to interactive design. The puppy embodies a sense of wonder and excitement, making it the perfect companion for my AT1 project, which aims to engage users with a delightful and lighthearted experience. The playful nature of the puppy perfectly aligns with the whimsical and evolving aesthetic I want to create, where the audience can feel the transformation from minimalism to cuteness as they interact with the sketch.

**2. What is the context of your kinship?**
The kinship I share with my kindred spirit, the puppy, is one of shared curiosity and playfulness. Both the puppy and I are motivated by the pursuit of joy through simple, interactive experiences. Just like a puppy might explore and engage with the world with enthusiasm and wonder, my creative work invites the user to explore and interact with a space that evolves from minimalist simplicity to a more joyful, playful cuteness. The relationship is grounded in a mutual desire to make people smile, to inspire engagement, and to introduce a sense of innocence through interaction.

**3. What is your common purpose?**
Our shared purpose is to evoke happiness and delight through interaction. I aim to create a moment of playful escape for the user, where they can temporarily leave behind the weight of everyday concerns and engage in a lighthearted, interactive experience. The puppy, as my kindred spirit, helps me fulfill this purpose by being the central character that the user can interact with and enjoy. The user becomes both an observer and a participant in this joyful environment, with the puppy’s actions and the visual elements responding to their interactions.

**4. Who or what is your shared challenge/adversary?**
Our shared challenge is the potential for the experience to become predictable or mundane. The adversary here is monotony—the risk that the interaction, while engaging at first, could become repetitive or lose its playful energy. To combat this, I’ve designed the sketch to transition from minimalism to cuteness, ensuring that the experience remains dynamic. This transition is essential to keep the user’s engagement fresh and exciting. The challenge lies in how well I balance the simplicity of minimalism with the charm and energy of cuteness. It’s a fine line to walk, as I want to maintain the playful, evolving nature of the interaction without losing the core essence of fun.

### **Explaining How Your Chosen Kindred Spirit Relates to the Visual, Sonic, and Interactive Elements of Your AT1 Idea:**

**1. Visuals:**
Visually, my kindred spirit—the puppy—will be rendered in two distinct phases: minimal and cute. Initially, the puppy will appear minimal and sleek, with clean lines and simple shapes. The background and the puppy will embody a sense of calmness, without excessive detail. As the user interacts and drags the wheel, the puppy will gradually evolve into a more detailed, playful character—one with larger eyes, a rounder shape, and a joyful expression. This transition from minimalism to cuteness mirrors the user’s journey from subtle interaction to joyful engagement.

In the minimal phase, the visuals will be simple and monochromatic, emphasizing geometric shapes and a calm color palette. As the puppy becomes more expressive in the cute phase, the color palette will shift to softer pastels, and the design will become rounder and more exaggerated. This visual transformation will be guided by the user’s interaction, with the puppy slowly becoming more "adorable" in response to their actions.

```javascript
// Minimal mode - clean, simple shapes for the puppy
fill(200, 200, 200);  // light, neutral color
ellipse(100, 100, 50, 50); // minimalist circle for the puppy
```

```javascript
// Cute mode - exaggerated, round shapes for the puppy
fill(250, 230, 190);  // soft, warm color
ellipse(100, 100, 60, 60); // rounder, more playful form for the puppy
```

**2. Sonic Elements:**
Sonically, the experience will start with subtle background noises, like a soft rolling sound or light wind, aligning with the minimal aesthetic. These sounds will remain calming and unobtrusive, creating an environment that feels serene and peaceful. However, as the user engages more actively with the wheel, the sounds will begin to transition into playful, cheerful tones. The puppy’s movement will trigger sound effects like light barking or cheerful yips, emphasizing the shift toward a more lively and interactive atmosphere.

For example, when the puppy begins to run, a higher-pitched "woof!" sound could play, and as the wheel spins faster, the background noise could increase in volume, mimicking the excitement of the puppy’s playful behavior. These audio cues will deepen the user’s connection to the visual and interactive elements, reinforcing the transformation from minimalism to cuteness.

```javascript
// Minimal mode - subtle, background rolling noise
rollingNoise.amp(0.1); // low amplitude for soft sounds
```

```javascript
// Cute mode - playful puppy sounds
clickOsc.freq(1000); // high-pitched sound as the puppy runs
clickEnv.play(clickOsc); // play the sound as the puppy moves
```

**3. Interactive Elements:**
The interactivity is where the transformation from minimalism to cuteness becomes most apparent. The user begins by dragging the wheel slowly, with subtle movement, but as they continue, the puppy starts running inside the wheel, and the environment shifts to a more energetic state. The interactivity is designed to make the user feel like they’re actively participating in the transformation, with the puppy’s actions reflecting their own engagement.

In the minimal mode, the wheel will rotate smoothly with no additional action from the puppy, but once the user drags faster, the puppy starts running, and more playful visual effects like sparkles and clouds will appear. This interaction creates a feedback loop: the more the user engages, the cuter and livelier the environment becomes. The user isn’t just an observer—they’re part of the narrative of the puppy’s transformation.

```javascript
// Minimal mode interaction - slow, smooth movement
rotation += currentSpeed * deltaTime;
```

```javascript
// Cute mode interaction - energetic, playful movement
isPuppyRunning = true; // Puppy starts running
puppyDirection = currentSpeed > 0 ? -1 : 1; // Puppy changes direction
```

---

### **Reflection and Feedback from a Colleague:**

**1. Visual Elements:**
- **How well did you achieve the cute aesthetic?**
  - "I think the transition from minimal to cute is effective. The shift in shapes and the use of softer colors help convey the 'cute' feeling, especially as the puppy becomes more expressive."
  
- **What could you try to increase the cuteness?**
  - "You could add more soft visual effects like floating hearts or sparkles to enhance the sense of playfulness."
  
- **How might you implement these improvements using JavaScript?**
  - "Consider adding a loop that randomly generates small heart shapes or sparkles around the puppy as it moves."

```javascript
// Add floating hearts around the puppy in cute mode
let heart = {
  x: random(width),
  y: random(height),
  size: random(5, 10),
  color: color(255, 120, 150)
};

drawHeart(heart.x, heart.y, heart.size, heart.color);
```

**2. Sonic Elements:**
- **How well did you achieve the cute aesthetic?**
  - "The audio transition from a neutral sound to a more playful one works well. I can imagine the puppy’s movements being accompanied by a joyful bark, which would make it feel even more interactive."
  
- **What could you try to increase the cuteness?**
  - "Maybe you could add more variation in the puppy's sounds, like a yawn or a happy whine."
  
- **How might you implement these improvements using JavaScript?**
  - "You could use `p5.SoundFile` to load and play different sound files based on the puppy’s actions, such as barking or whining."

```javascript
// Load puppy sounds
let barkSound;
function preload() {
  barkSound = loadSound('bark.mp3');
}

function mousePressed() {
  barkSound.play(); // Play bark sound when the user interacts
}
```

**3. Interaction:**
- **How well did you achieve the cute aesthetic?**
  - "The way the puppy’s actions change based on the user’s interaction is very engaging. It feels like the user is guiding the puppy’s transformation from minimal to cute."
  
- **What could you try to increase the cuteness?**
  - "Perhaps adding some exaggerated animations, like the puppy bouncing as it runs, would increase the sense of joy and playfulness."
  
- **How might you implement these improvements using JavaScript?**
  - "You can use a sine wave function to make the puppy's movement bounce up and down in a playful way as it runs."

```javascript
// Add a bouncing effect to the puppy in cute mode
let bounce = sin(frame) * 5;
translate(0, bounce);
```

---

### Conclusion:
This deeper exploration of the kindred spirit, the shared purpose, and the adversary highlights the emotional connection between the user and the puppy within the interactive experience. By refining the visuals, sounds, and interactions, I aim to achieve the perfect balance between minimalism and cuteness, ensuring that the puppy’s transformation is both delightful and engaging. The feedback from colleagues offers valuable insights that I can use to further enhance the cuteness of the sketch through small, yet impactful changes.



# Learning Journey: Understanding and Recreating Rafaël Rozendaal’s "Falling" Animation

In this post, I’ll walk through my journey of analyzing and understanding the p5.js recreation of **"Falling"** by Rafaël Rozendaal, and my experience working through the code. I'll describe the main features of the code, the challenges I faced, and the resources I used to help me understand difficult sections. Throughout the process, I’ll be documenting my thoughts, sharing screenshots, and embedding p5.js sketches to better explain my understanding and creative process.

---

## **Understanding the Code: Main Features and Explanation**

The provided code creates an animation of waves made from gradient shapes falling down the screen. The falling objects are drawn using a combination of curves and colors that change over time, creating a dynamic, organic movement. Here’s an in-depth look at how the code works:

### **1. Initialization: Creating and Storing Objects**

- The code starts by defining an object `faller`, which serves as a template for the falling waves. A list of `fallers` is initialized to store multiple instances of these objects.
- In the `setup` function, the canvas size is set to match the browser window size, and HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) color mode is enabled for easier color manipulation.
  
```javascript
// Initializing the faller object template
const faller = {}

// Array to store multiple faller objects
const fallers = []

// Background color variable
let bg
```

### **2. Creating the Wave Path (Start and End Points)**

The `faller` object contains two main sets of points: **start points** and **end points**. These represent the positions where the waves start (on the top part of the screen) and where they end (towards the bottom).

```javascript
// Defining the start points for the waves (from top-left to top-right)
faller.start_points = [
    { x: 0, y: height / 2 }, // Left middle
    { x: 0, y: 0 },          // Top left
    { x: width / 4, y: 0 },   // Top-left quarter
    { x: width / 2, y: 0 },   // Center top
    { x: width * 3 / 4, y: 0 }, // Top-right quarter
    { x: width, y: 0 },       // Top right
    { x: width, y: height / 2 }, // Right middle
]
```

### **3. Gradient Colors**

Each wave has a gradient color effect between two colors (`colours[0]` and `colours[1]`). These colors are dynamically generated using the `rand_col()` function that creates random hues for each wave.

```javascript
faller.colours = [rand_col(), rand_col()]
```

### **4. Curve Function: Creating Organic Movement**

The `rand_curve()` function generates random values between 1 and 3. These values determine how quickly or slowly each wave element moves along its path. This randomness gives the waves an organic feel, as each wave behaves differently.

```javascript
// Generate random curve values for the movement
faller.curves = new Array(7).fill().map(rand_curve)
```

---

## **Challenges and Things I Didn’t Understand Initially**

While analyzing and implementing this code, I encountered a few challenges. Some sections took a bit more time to understand fully, especially the logic behind the wave movement and the interpolation between points.

### **1. The `faller.curves` Initialization**

```javascript
faller.curves = new Array(7).fill().map(rand_curve)
```

This line creates an array with 7 elements, each filled with a random value between 1 and 3 (generated by `rand_curve`). Initially, I wasn’t sure how the array was being populated. It turns out that `fill()` generates `undefined` elements, and then `map()` applies `rand_curve` to each element. This generates 7 random values, which influence the movement curves of each wave.

### **2. The `find_point` Function**

```javascript
const p = find_point(s, f.end_points[i], f.phase ** f.curves[i])
```

Here, `f.phase ** f.curves[i]` calculates a "curved" progression between the start and end points. The `**` operator is the exponentiation operator, so this is raising the phase value to a power defined by the corresponding curve value. This results in a non-linear movement along the wave's path, where higher curve values slow down the wave's movement initially and speed it up toward the end.

### **3. The `unshift` Method**

```javascript
fallers.unshift(new_faller)
```

The `unshift` method is used to add the new `faller` object to the beginning of the `fallers` array. This means that the new wave starts appearing on top of the older ones, giving the effect of waves continuously being generated as the animation progresses.

---

## **Resources and Communities I Reached Out To**

To better understand these sections of the code, I used a few key resources:

1. **p5.js Reference**: The official p5.js website (https://p5js.org) provided a lot of clarity on functions like `fill()`, `map()`, and `colorMode()`. I consulted it for syntax and function behavior.
  
2. **MDN Web Docs**: To better understand JavaScript operators (such as the `**` for exponentiation), I referred to the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN). Their explanations on operators and array methods like `map()` and `unshift()` were especially helpful.

3. **Stack Overflow**: For specific questions about `fill()` and `map()`, I found discussions and code examples on Stack Overflow that clarified their functionality and use cases.

4. **Creative Coding Community**: I connected with other p5.js enthusiasts and creative coders via forums and social media groups, where people share their projects and insights. This community provided inspiration and troubleshooting support.

---

## **Next Steps: Expanding and Modifying the Code**

Now that I have a better understanding of the code, here are a few modifications and ideas for expanding the animation:

1. **Speed Adjustment**:
   I could add a variable to control the speed of the wave movement. For example:
   
   ```javascript
   let waveSpeed = 0.008;
   ```

   Then, adjust the `phase` increment in the `draw()` function:

   ```javascript
   f.phase += waveSpeed;
   ```

2. **Interactive Modifications**:
   Adding mouse interaction could make the waves react to user input. For instance, waves could appear where the user clicks:

   ```javascript
   function mousePressed() {
     const new_faller = Object.assign({}, faller);
     new_faller.colours = [bg, rand_col()];
     new_faller.curves = new Array(7).fill().map(rand_curve);
     fallers.unshift(new_faller);
     bg = rand_col();
   }
   ```

3. **Limited Color Palette**:
   To create a more cohesive visual effect, I could limit the wave colors to a specific palette. For example:

   ```javascript
   const palette = [color(0, 100, 100), color(60, 100, 100), color(120, 100, 100)];
   
   function rand_col() {
     return random(palette);
   }
   ```

These changes could enhance the aesthetic and interaction of the animation, making it feel more dynamic and user-driven.

---

## **Conclusion**

Recreating and understanding Rafaël Rozendaal’s **"Falling"** animation in p5.js has been a great learning experience. By breaking down each section of the code and experimenting with variations, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of how to manipulate shapes, colors, and animations programmatically. The next step in my journey will be to continue exploring ways to make the animation more interactive and visually striking, while applying these concepts to future creative coding projects.

# Achieving the "Cute" Aesthetic in My AT1 Using p5.js

For my **AT1** (Assignment 1), my goal is to create a playful, engaging, and cute aesthetic through visuals, sound, and interactivity. To do this, I plan to combine minimalist design with subtle animations and simple interactions that encourage delight and joy in the user. Below, I’ll explain how I plan on achieving the aesthetic register of cute for each of these elements.

---

## **Visual Cuteness: Simple, Rounded, and Playful**

### **Plan for Achieving Visual Cuteness**
To create a cute visual aesthetic in my sketch, I’ll focus on **soft, rounded shapes**, **pastel colors**, and **simple, clean lines**. Instead of sharp angles or complex designs, I will use soft circles, ellipses, and other smooth, organic shapes to evoke a sense of warmth and approachability. This is a common visual technique associated with the "cute" aesthetic, as these shapes feel non-threatening and friendly.

In terms of color, I’ll use **pastel shades** like soft pinks, blues, and yellows to create a soothing and playful atmosphere. The use of **gradients** and **subtle animations** will also help enhance the "cute" feeling by adding depth and fluidity to the visuals without overwhelming the viewer.

### **Example p5.js Code (Visual Cuteness)**
```javascript
function drawCutePuppy(x, y, size) {
  fill(255, 200, 200); // Soft pink for the body
  ellipse(x, y, size, size); // Puppy body

  fill(255, 240, 200); // Lighter color for face
  ellipse(x, y - size / 3, size / 2, size / 2); // Puppy face
  
  fill(50, 255, 100); // Soft green for eyes
  ellipse(x - size / 6, y - size / 3, size / 8, size / 8); // Left eye
  ellipse(x + size / 6, y - size / 3, size / 8, size / 8); // Right eye
}
```

### **Feedback from a Colleague (Visuals)**:
- **How well did you achieve a cute aesthetic?**  
  *"The soft color palette and rounded shapes do give off a very friendly and playful vibe. The use of pastel colors also contributes to the cuteness."*

- **What could you try to increase the cuteness?**  
  *"You could consider adding blushes to the puppy's cheeks or small details like a wagging tail or little paws. These details often enhance the 'cute' factor."*

- **How might you implement these improvements using JavaScript?**  
  *"You can add a blush effect by using small, soft circles or ellipses near the cheeks with a light pink color. A wagging tail can be created by using a sine wave animation for smooth, playful motion."*

---

## **Sonic Cuteness: Playful, High-Pitched, and Satisfying**

### **Plan for Achieving Sonic Cuteness**
For the sonic element, I will focus on **simple, playful sounds** that respond directly to the user’s interactions. High-pitched "blips" or "pops" will be used for interactions like mouse clicks or wheel rotations, as these sounds are often associated with toys or playful objects. The audio will be light and not overly complex, which is a core feature of "cute" sound design.

### **Example p5.js Code (Sonic Cuteness)**
```javascript
let clickOsc;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  clickOsc = new p5.Oscillator('sine');
  clickOsc.amp(0);
  clickOsc.start();
}

function mousePressed() {
  clickOsc.freq(random(600, 1000)); // Random frequency for a playful tone
  clickOsc.amp(0.3, 0.05); // Short, soft sound
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
}
```

### **Feedback from a Colleague (Sonic Elements)**:
- **How well did you achieve a cute aesthetic?**  
  *"The sound is light and playful, especially with the high-pitched frequency. It’s simple and doesn’t overpower the visual experience."*

- **What could you try to increase the cuteness?**  
  *"You could add a subtle sound effect whenever something changes in the animation—like a soft 'woof' when the puppy moves or a small sound when the wheel spins. These sounds would reinforce the playful nature."*

- **How might you implement these improvements using JavaScript?**  
  *"You can use the `p5.SoundFile` library to load specific sound files (like a puppy bark or a soft squeak) and play them in response to different interactions. For example, you could play a 'woof' sound whenever the puppy reaches a new position."*

---

## **Interactive Cuteness: Simple, Immediate, and Fun**

### **Plan for Achieving Interactive Cuteness**
To make the interaction feel cute, I want to ensure that the **user’s actions immediately trigger visual and sonic feedback**. The interaction should be simple and intuitive—something anyone can understand immediately, with no instructions required. I will create **cause-and-effect relationships** where the user’s actions, like dragging or clicking, lead directly to changes in the visuals and sounds. 

The idea is to make the user feel like they are playing with a digital toy. For example, dragging the wheel should cause the puppy to move, and clicking should make the puppy bark or cause a visual change (like a tail wag). This creates a sense of discovery and fun without overwhelming the user with complex controls.

### **Example p5.js Code (Interactive Cuteness)**
```javascript
let puppyX = 200;
let puppyY = 200;
let speed = 2;

function draw() {
  background(220);
  
  // Move the puppy with the arrow keys
  if (keyIsDown(LEFT_ARROW)) {
    puppyX -= speed;
  }
  if (keyIsDown(RIGHT_ARROW)) {
    puppyX += speed;
  }
  if (keyIsDown(UP_ARROW)) {
    puppyY -= speed;
  }
  if (keyIsDown(DOWN_ARROW)) {
    puppyY += speed;
  }
  
  // Draw the puppy
  drawCutePuppy(puppyX, puppyY, 50);
}

function drawCutePuppy(x, y, size) {
  fill(255, 200, 200);
  ellipse(x, y, size, size); // Puppy body
}
```

### **Feedback from a Colleague (Interactivity)**:
- **How well did you achieve a cute aesthetic?**  
  *"The immediate feedback from moving the puppy with arrow keys is fun and engaging. It feels intuitive and lighthearted."*

- **What could you try to increase the cuteness?**  
  *"Consider adding more playful animations, like a wagging tail when the puppy moves, or even a jump animation when the user presses a specific key. These small movements will add to the playfulness."*

- **How might you implement these improvements using JavaScript?**  
  *"To add a wagging tail, use a sine wave to animate the tail’s rotation based on the puppy's movement speed. A jump can be created by altering the `y` position momentarily when the user presses a specific key."*

## **Conclusion: Bringing the Cute Aesthetic to Life**

Through this process, I’ve outlined how I plan to achieve the "cute" aesthetic in my AT1 project using **visual elements**, **sonic design**, and **interactive elements**. By focusing on **rounded shapes**, **playful sounds**, and **intuitive interactions**, I aim to create a delightful, engaging experience that feels like a digital toy. I will continue refining these aspects and integrating feedback to ensure the overall experience is joyful, approachable, and fun for users.

In the next steps, I will implement these features and test them with different interactions to ensure they align with the "cute" aesthetic, making the experience both accessible and engaging for a wide audience.
