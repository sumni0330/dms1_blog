# 👩🏻‍💻Turning Skincare Community Data into Interactive Art

Honestly, I used to think of skincare communities as just places to find good product recommendations. But last semester, things changed for me.

While living in Australia as an international student, I shared a house with a bunch of foreign roommates—and, to my surprise, they were _super_ into K-skincare. Almost every other day, someone would ask, “What should I use for better skin?” or “Have you tried this Korean product?” I ended up sharing a lot of my own stuff from Korea, and it made me realize just how global K-beauty has become.

But as I got more involved, I noticed something interesting: even though everyone’s skin concerns were different, we all kept talking about **specific issues in specific areas**. Like, “I always break out on my chin,” “I get flaky patches on my cheeks,” or “my forehead gets oily but my cheeks are super dry.” Over and over, it was about _where_ the problem showed up, not just _what_ the problem was.

When I interviewed people for a UX class project, these patterns got even clearer. I heard things like, “I always struggle with redness on my cheeks,” or “Only my jawline gets acne.” Of course, these kinds of problems are common in Korea too, but living in Australia, there are extra twists—products that worked back home don’t always work here. The climate is drier, the sun is stronger, even the water feels different. It turns out a Korean skincare routine isn’t a magic bullet for everyone, everywhere.

So for my AT3 project, I want to use **creative coding to visualize all these skin concerns** in a way that’s interactive and fun—something that goes beyond just reading posts and comments.

## Idea 1: Visualizing Skin Concerns on a UV Map

- I’d take a 3D face model or a simple flat image of a face, and use it as a “skin map.”
- Each time someone in the community mentions a skin problem in a certain area (like “oily T-zone,” “flaky cheeks,” “jawline acne”), I’d represent it directly on the map.
- For example:
  - Red patches for redness on the cheeks
  - Shiny effects for oily zones
  - Dotted textures for breakout-prone spots, etc.
- The more often a problem is mentioned in a certain area, the stronger or bigger the effect would show up on the map.

## Idea 2: An Interactive “Skin Concern Map”

- When you hover over (or tap) different areas, popups would show the most common problems there—and maybe even random real user comments from the community.
- Or, you could enter your own skin issues, and the map would update in real time, showing how your concerns overlap with others—kind of a “you’re not alone” vibe.

## Why do I want to do this?

Honestly, it’s easy to scroll through posts in a skincare forum, but it’s hard to get a sense of _how_ common your own problem really is, or where it tends to show up for other people.  
If I can turn this data into a kind of “skin map,” I think it would make it way more relatable than just text or lists—it would turn shared struggles into something _visual_ and even a little fun.

## Connecting to Ngai’s Aesthetic Registers

- **Cute:** The graphics would be colorful and friendly, maybe with sticker-like icons for each type of concern.
- **Interesting:** The project would let people see patterns in the data and find out, “Oh wow, it’s not just me!”
- **Zany:** There’s something kind of funny and playful about seeing breakouts or redness animated on a digital face, especially if I add effects or emojis.

## Wrapping Up

For this project, I want to turn real data from a community I belong to into interactive visual art. By combining interviews, routine lists, and actual user experiences with creative coding, I hope to make something that’s not just informative, but also engaging and genuinely relatable.

## The Live Coding Community of Practice

### 1. Interesting Live Coding Content & Why I Find It Engaging

- [TOPLAP manifesto](https://toplap.org/about/): The manifesto itself is a great introduction to the values and attitude of the community—it's playful, open, and encourages experimentation.
- [Algorave performances](https://algorave.com/): I find these fascinating because they combine club culture and algorithmic art, turning code into dance music, with code projected for the audience to see.
- [Hydra Gallery](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/gallery): This site showcases creative, experimental visual work shared by the community, making it easy to see the diversity of styles and approaches.

I find live coding interesting because of the transparency—the audience can see the code, mistakes and all, as part of the performance. There's a sense of vulnerability and authenticity that makes every show unique.

### 2. Domain, Repertoire, and Values of the Community

**Domain:**  
The live coding community focuses on real-time, algorithmic creation of music and/or visuals using code as a performance medium.

**Repertoire:**

- Live coding performances (projecting code as it's written)
- Collaborative jams (both online and offline)
- Use of custom tools/languages like Hydra (visuals), Strudel (audio), TidalCycles, SuperCollider, etc.
- Sharing code, remixing, tutorials, and workshops

**Values:**

- Openness (sharing code and knowledge)
- Playfulness and experimentation
- Embracing mistakes as part of the creative process
- Collaboration and inclusivity
- Transparency (audience can see exactly what’s happening)

### 3. Relation to Cultural Performance, Youth Motivation, Education, Public Discourse, Legislation

**Cultural Performance Practices:**  
Live coding is itself a cultural performance, merging music, art, and technology. It brings the creative process onto the stage, making it visible and participatory.

**Young People's Motivation for Learning:**  
Live coding appeals to young people because it's creative, social, and immediate. Seeing code make music or visuals in real time makes programming feel accessible, playful, and relevant—often much more motivating than abstract classroom exercises.

**Education Systems & Pedagogy:**  
Live coding is used as a teaching tool to demystify programming and make it interactive. Teachers can demonstrate ideas in real time, and students can experiment and get feedback instantly. It encourages exploration, collaboration, and learning from mistakes.

**Discourse / Public Debate:**  
Live coding challenges traditional boundaries between artist/audience and performer/programmer. By making code visible, it invites discussions about creativity, authorship, and the role of technology in art and society.

**Legislation:**  
Issues sometimes arise around copyright and intellectual property, since performances often involve remixing and sharing code openly. The community tends to favor open licenses and a sharing ethos, but legal frameworks can lag behind, leading to ongoing debates about ownership and credit.
